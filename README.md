# QuickAdmin
Access lots of administrative windows from a single panel.

Microsoft is known for hiding lots of old, reliable administrative settings, windows, and programs behind newer (and less functional) user interfaces. I get tired of hunting these down, either behind multiple menus, or trying to remember the right commands, or often needing look it up. (Especially when setting up a new computer.)

So I made this.

Granted, several of these are findable by searching from the Start menu or right-clicking the start menu. But many are not directly accessible this way.

This isn't designed to be comprehensive. I wouldn't want it to be so overwhelming anyway; these are just ones I use or think you might likely use. I'll possibly update this a few more times as I make changes/additions.

### Disclaimers and Environment

This was designed and working in Windows 10 64-bit. I'll have to try it on Windows 11 someday when I have it, but I assume almost all items here will work the same.

This is created with AutoHotKey, which is a safe program, but Windows often doesn't like it. You are safe to run this .exe, but if you still have any security concerns (or if Windows keeps deleting it), you can download AHK from https://www.autohotkey.com/ to run the .ahk file directly or compile it into your own .exe instead.

If you decide to download AutoHotKey to run this file, please get V1.1 (not 2.0) and install the 64-bit version. If you compile into your own .exe, please compile with the 64-bit option.
